# Python Challenges

These challenges are aimed at people who've already learned the basics of
Python.  They're meant to encourage you to use some of the more interesting
features of Python, and help you to write more "Pythonic" code...


# Python challenges in this repo

[Magic methods and Duck typing](magic_methods.py)  - learn how to make your classes Pythonic using magic methods like `__len__` and more (for guidance see Rafe Kettler's excellent doc at http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html)

[Decorators](decorators.py) - decorators, a pretty way of transforming functions using other functions. functional programming!  functions.

[Context managers](context_managers.py) - aka the `with` statement.  What's it for, and how does it help to make your code look nicer?

[Generators](generators.py) - more efficient iterators with python and the `yield` statement.

[The Game of Life](life.md) - a programming classic.  Try it out using OO and functional paradigms in Python.
